This is on the back of an optimistic 2018/2019 in the industry and there are positive trends predicted for future of the industry.
                    <br><br>World Oil analysts have forecast drilling activity across eight major regions is set to increase from 2019 onwards. The activity is set to take place in the biggest oil and gas producers in eight regions of North America excluding the U.S, South America, Western Europe, Eastern Europe/former Soviet Union (FSU), Africa, the Middle East, Far East/South Asia, and South Pacific.
                    <br><br>Forecast is that growth in offshore oil and gas drilling will outpace the overall global drilling market. While total global drilling activity— excluding the U.S.—is set to rise by 2.5 per cent this year. The most active offshore drilling areas will include East Canada, Brazil, Norway, Angola, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi, China, and India, according to World Oil.
                    <br><br>Drilling in Africa is expected to grow at the fastest pace among all regions, by 8.7 per cent, with Angola and Egypt leading the way. GMT is looking to ride the wave of the increased upstream activity in a sustainable and efficient manner.

                    Natural gas, is at last taking centre stage across Africa as countries embrace it as a cheap and sustainable source of energy. In 2017 Africa had proven natural gas reserves of 503.3 trillion cubic feet, according to the International Energy Agency, with West Africa, owning most of the reserves. Nigeria’s gas reserves are thought to be the largest in Africa at 5.2 trillion cubic metres, according to statistics and poised to become one of the largest energy players as it prepares for what it calls a Gas Revolution.
                    <br><br>Our focus on gas allows us to play a significant role in the race for gas across Africa, a continent with a reserve base that is comparable to Qatar.
                    <br><br>We have bright people that are aggressive about gas exploration; we are prepared to drill wells, which some majors will not touch; we are ready to make significant investments to explore and harness the power of Gas in innovative ways, contributing to the global supply of LNG.

                It remains undisputed that Nigeria requires a transformation of its power sector. GMT Power is committed to building an infrastructure base to help the country make substantial advancements in the sector.
                <br><br>We are well placed to drive the right levels of investments into the country that will accelerate power generation capacity and utilisation; expand power transmission networks and improve the country’s power distribution capabilities.
                <br><br>Nigeria has abundant gas reserves of 192 trillion cubic feet (5.4 trillion cubic metres), and gas provides nearly 80 per cent of power generation.
                <br><br>Despite this, power stations have found themselves short of gas due to insufficient pipeline capacity, a lack of pipeline connections and sabotage of pipes.
                <br><br>In summary, as of February 2018, Nigeria’s generation capacity consisted of 10,729MW of gas power and 2,358MW of hydropower.
                <br><br>The prediction is that by 2023, gas power will provide 18,095MW, hydropower 3,809MW, solar 779MW, wind 60MW and diesel 215MW. This means that by 2023, gas power generation will remain the dominant source of power, despite investment in expansion of renewables.
                <br>GMT is gearing up to become a dominant player in the power sector and contribute towards the power generation forecasts.
                <br>We are investing in infrastructure, technical partnership, major collaborations and new technologies to be a reliable supplier to the National grid.
